FUTURE PROJECTS

-case study animation
    -switch shrinkUp to multi step: first fade out text, then shrink/maxheight/remove margins.  reverse this on grow

-visuals
    -link hover slide underline effect (was on twitter, now try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34028802/transition-sliding-underline-jumping)

-one folder for admin
    -set up subscription using angularfire to view existing form_submissions, add notes, delete, etc.
    eventually, this will be a login (guards protected) for me to update site and add blog posts, etc.?
    this would be own module, lazy loaded (wouldn't be needed for majority of visitors, just me).

TODO
-form setup (email backend? - eventually, save in db and send me notification to check admin panel)
    -styles done, now link it up to send to firebase?  or email to me?  or send to firebase, then notify me!
    -anti spam (use bothoneypot)

-write about section

-projects section info and pages (child routes)

-case studies (child routes)

-visuals
    -angular animation on route change (sub route change)
        -see pluralsight video
    -link hover slide underline effect (was on twitter, now try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34028802/transition-sliding-underline-jumping)

-one folder for admin
    eventually, this will be a login (guards protected) for me to update site and add blog posts, etc.?
    this would be own module, lazy loaded (wouldn't be needed for majority of visitors, just me).

-simple node server (see qtzl example- really just need to return base route for now, but eventually will need api endpoints if going for custom blog and content editing).
    -or use firebase?  looks like they have a 'spa' option that just rewrites the routes.  if I use them for db, it would all just be api calls to firebase anyway

hosting: aws? google?
    -check out firebase:  can have free tier db and hosting?

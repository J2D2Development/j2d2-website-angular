TODO

JOB 1:
    finish contact form confirmation msg formatting!!!

-wedding website as example: fix comments section?
    -mysql gone?  try reinstalling?

-add link to resume (also; write resume)

-form setup
    -validations:
        investigate: firebase backend data validation?  maybe on:
            functions.database.ref('/form_submissions').onWrite(event
            -is there a 'beforeWrite' hook?  if so, try putting validators there and rejecting if bad submission
            -fe validation for spam honeypot does nothing (bots can just override js).  need backend check on the checkbox!
    -set 'view' on this to require login, but 'write' to not (anyone can submit form, only I can view)
    -http://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-firebase/

-review/revise about section

-MOBILE FRIENDLY

-case studies (child routes)
    -on click of button, show study (animate in) and input/event emit header variable for height
    -review/revise content

-visuals
    -link hover slide underline effect (was on twitter, now try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34028802/transition-sliding-underline-jumping)

-one folder for admin
    -set up subscription using angularfire to view existing form_submissions, add notes, delete, etc.
    eventually, this will be a login (guards protected) for me to update site and add blog posts, etc.?
    this would be own module, lazy loaded (wouldn't be needed for majority of visitors, just me).

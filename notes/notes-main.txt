TODO

-form setup
    -anti spam (use bothoneypot)
    -angularfire- form submissions saved in db. set up function (on firebase?) to notify me via email.
    -set 'view' on this to require login, but 'write' to not (anyone can submit form, only I can view)
    -http://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-firebase/

-review/revise about section

-MOBILE FRIENDLY

-projects section info
    -update links (angular twitch broken- fix it or link a different project)

-case studies (child routes)
    -on click of button, show study (animate in) and input/event emit header variable for height
    -using css transitions, looks like complete shit.  forget for now- write case study content instead

-visuals
    -angular animation on route change (sub route change)
        -see pluralsight video
    -link hover slide underline effect (was on twitter, now try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34028802/transition-sliding-underline-jumping)

-one folder for admin
    -set up subscription using angularfire to view existing form_submissions, add notes, delete, etc.
    eventually, this will be a login (guards protected) for me to update site and add blog posts, etc.?
    this would be own module, lazy loaded (wouldn't be needed for majority of visitors, just me).

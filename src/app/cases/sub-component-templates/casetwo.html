            It was early 2015.  I'd beeen working as a junior developer for about 6 months and almost felt mildly competent writing jQuery.  Bootstrap was still king for layouts and modals and mobile friendly design (at least, it was in my household).  Digital Ocean was offering dirt cheap hosting for just about any stack you could imagine.

            We'd need a website, of course.  Our guests would need super simple links to the items we wanted them to buy for us.  And a map to the venue so they could deliver said items directly to our hands.  And maybe an RSVP form, letting our guests notify us that they would be bringing us lovely gifts.

            "I can do this", I thought, "no problem!" (Ha).  I made a lot of mistakes, but also learned a lot about the many different aspects of the web.

            I downloaded Xampp to run a development server and created an index.html for my jQuery and Bootstrap scripts and got coding.  So far so good- for the most part.  We'd been gifted a nice Google Docs spreadsheet template for tracking guests, vendors, open items, etc.  I created a Google Form that would submit directly to that spreadsheet, then found a workaround that would let me generate my own form and replace the Google one (to better match my own layout).  Basically, you just inspect the elements on the generated form for the ids.  You can then match those ids on your own form, submit it to the correct docs.google.com/forms url in your form 'action' attr, and you're good to go!  It was a while ago, so I'm sure it took some tweaking, but eventually it worked great!

            I wanted a guestbook type feature, so I installed MariaDB and created a simple form to allow visitors to submit their name and any good (or ill) wishes.  Now we're getting a little more complicated- I wanted the form to submit via ajax, then reload the guestbook without reloading the whole screen.  So I created a couple php handlers- one to submit a comment, one to reload the comments.  jQuery ajax functions would call the appropriate function when it was time.

        <div class="img-flow img-flow-lg col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <code [innerHTML]="phpSubmitSnippet"></code>
            <div class="caption">Part of the php submit handler.  It tries to add the comment to the database just returns error or success- the frontend jQuery function deals with the rest.</div>

            As referenced earlier, I made a lot of mistakes.  If I was doing this again today, I'd create something that could be hosted on Google's Firebase service (as this site is).  That way, the deployment process would be a tiny bit of config and running 'firebase deploy' on the command line.  With this project, the server configuration easily doubled the development of the actual website.  One issue in particular was <a href="https://j2d2development.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/fully-unqualified-sys-admin/" target="_blank">documented in an old blog post</a>- it's still too painful to relive just yet.

            I was also somewhat new to version control, so I set up a github repo for my code to get some practice.  I would work on the project on my desktop, then my laptop, and use github to sync between the two.  It was good practice on the basics, but it took some trial and error.  If you visit that repo, you'll probably find some config and ini files that were accidentally pushed, and maybe even a couple local login strings for my Xampp test environment.  Stupid mistakes, but better to make them on a personal project than on something client facing!

            The site is still up at <a href="http://www.driscollwedding.com" target="_blank">driscollwedding.com</a> as a historical record.  The RSVP form is no longer active (I think you can submit, but it won't go anywhere), but the rest should run just fine.  The biggest lesson learned: you can set up a server yourself, but it might take quite a bit of time and a whole lot of frustration.
